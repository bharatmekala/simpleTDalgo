## Introduction

This project provides a basic reinforcement learning environment where an agent can move between states, receive rewards, and learn using Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm (TD(0)).

## Features

- States with rewards and termination conditions
- State connections for agent movement
- TD(0) and TD(λ) learning algorithms for value function updates
