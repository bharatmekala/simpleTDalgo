## Introduction

This project provides a basic reinforcement learning environment where an agent can move between states, receive rewards, and learn using Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm (TD(0)).

## Features

- States with rewards and termination conditions
- State connections for agent movement
- TD(0) and TD(λ) learning algorithms for value function updates

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.10
- NumPy
- colorama

### Installation
